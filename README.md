üå∏ Bloomr - Shopify E-Commerce Website Development & Redesign
üõ†Ô∏è Private Project ¬∑ Case Study Only

üîç Overview
This document provides a case study of my role in managing the entire e-commerce lifecycle for Bloomr, from its initial launch as a startup to its growth into an established online brand. The project encompassed the initial website build, a major theme and site structure redesign, and ongoing technical and operational management.

As the code and theme assets are proprietary to Bloomr and managed within their private Shopify environment, this repository serves as a detailed project summary rather than a code host.
