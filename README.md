#üé® Global Design System Roll-out @ Berlin Brands Group#

**üõ†Ô∏è Private Project ¬∑ Case Study Only**

## üîç Overview ##

This case study outlines my work as a Frontend Developer on a major Global Design System roll-out at Berlin Brands Group (BBG). The objective was to create a unified and modern user experience by implementing a new UX/UI design across four of BBG's major e-commerce brands: Klarstein, electronic star, blumfeldt, and Auna.

The project required a systematic implementation of new design components across the entire customer journey, from the home page to the checkout, ensuring brand consistency while leveraging a shared codebase. All work was performed on the Oxid e-commerce CMS.

Full Funnel Integration: Rolling out the new design across all key areas of the e-commerce sites, including Home Pages, Product Listing Pages (PLPs), Product Detail Pages (PDPs), Contact Pages, footers, and menu bars.

CMS & Personalization Integration: Implementing the frontend changes within the Oxid CMS and ensuring seamless integration with personalization tools like Dynamic Yield and Bloomreach.

Cross-Browser & Responsive Testing: Ensuring all new components were fully responsive and functioned perfectly across different browsers and devices.
